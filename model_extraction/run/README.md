# Run experiments

These python scripts allow us to set parameters and easily run the experiments
as well as debug them, for example, when using PyCharm or other IDE.

The standard arguments are in `model_extraction/run/utils.py`.

If we want to run standard pate on mnist, then we can use
the `run_standard_pate_mnist.py` file.
